	This struct holds the data received from aircraft via ADS-B messages (ADSB).
	It is received in a format called "SBS1 (BaseStation) format".
	These ADSB messages are provided by the dump1090 program and are available on port 30003 (by default).
	Messages (MSG) received from aircraft may be one of eight types.

	reference: http://woodair.net/sbs/article/barebones42_socket_data.htm

	Examples:
	MSG,4,5,211,4CA2D6,10057,2008/11/28,14:53:49.986,2008/11/28,14:58:51.153,,,408.3,146.4,,,64,,,,,
